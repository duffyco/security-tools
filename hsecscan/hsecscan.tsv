Transport-layer encryption, such as that employed in HTTPS, is insufficient to prevent a network attacker from obtaining or altering a victim's cookies because the cookie protocol itself has various vulnerabilities.

Strict-Transport-Security	Permanent	http	standard	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797	Response	Y	Y	Y	HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism which helps to protect secure HTTPS websites against downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol. HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797	Please at least read this reference: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security.

TCN	Permanent	http		https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2295#section-8.5	Response	Y	N	N	The TCN response header is used by a server to signal that the resource is transparently negotiated. Malicious servers could use transparent content negotiation as a means of obtaining information about security holes which may be present in user agents. This is a risk in particular for negotiation on the availability of scripting languages and libraries.	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2295#section-14.3	If the resource is not transparently negotiated, a TCN header MUST NOT be included in any response. If the resource is transparently negotiated, a TCN header, which includes the response-type value of the response, MUST be included in every response with a 2xx status code or any 3xx status code, except 304, in which it MAY be included. A TCN header MAY also be included, without a response-type value, in other responses from transparently negotiated resources.

Transfer-Encoding	Permanent	http	standard	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.1	Response	Y	N	N	Response splitting (a.k.a, CRLF injection) is a common technique, used in various attacks on Web usage, that exploits the line-based nature of HTTP message framing and the ordered association of requests to responses on persistent connections. This technique can be particularly damaging when the requests pass through a shared cache.	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-9	A common defense against response splitting is to filter requests for data that looks like encoded CR and LF (e.g., "%0D" and "%0A"). However, that assumes the application server is only performing URI decoding, rather than more obscure data transformations like charset transcoding, XML entity translation, base64 decoding, sprintf reformatting, etc. A more effective mitigation is to prevent anything other than the server's core protocol libraries from sending a CR or LF within the header section, which means restricting the output of header fields to APIs that filter for bad octets and not allowing application servers to write directly to the protocol stream.

This is done by a policy declared in the HTTP header and enforced by browser implementations.	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034	 In 2009 and 2010, many browser vendors ([Microsoft-X-Frame-Options] and [Mozilla-X-Frame-Options]) introduced the use of a non-standard HTTP [RFC2616] header field "X-Frame-Options" to protect against clickjacking.

Access-Control-Allow-Credentials	Provisional	http		http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-credentials-response-header	Response	Y	N	N	The Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header indicates whether the response to request can be exposed when the omit credentials flag is unset. When part of the response to a preflight request it indicates that the actual request can include user credentials.	http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#security	If the resource supports credentials add a single Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, with the value of the Origin header as value, and add a single Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header with the case-sensitive string "true" as value. Otherwise, add a single Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, with either the value of the Origin header or the string "*" as value. The string "*" cannot be used for a resource that supports credentials. Resources for which simple requests have significance other than retrieval must protect themselves from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) by requiring the inclusion of an unguessable token in the explicitly provided content of the request.

Content-Type is to be listed as only a subset of its values makes it qualify as simple header.

Since the list of methods can be unbounded, simply returning the method indicated by Access-Control-Request-Method (if supported) can be enough.

Access-Control-Allow-Origin	Provisional	http		http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-origin-response-header	Response	Y	N	N	The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header indicates whether a resource can be shared based by returning the value of the Origin request header, "*", or "null" in the response.	http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#security	A GET response whose entity body happens to parse as ECMAScript can return an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header whose value is "*" provided there are no sensitive comments as it can be accessed cross-origin using an HTML script element.
