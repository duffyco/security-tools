# Current Version: 1.7.5

## Important note:  Malwoverview does NOT submit samples to Virus Total or Hybrid Analysis by default. It submits only hashes, so respecting Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). Nonetheless, if you use the "-V" (uppercase) or "-A" (uppercase), so Malwoverview SUBMITS your malware sample to Virus Total or Hybrid Analysis, respectively. 


# ABOUT

Malwoverview.py is a simple tool to perform an initial and quick triage on a directory containing malware samples (not zipped).  

This tool aims to : 

1. Determining similar executable malware samples (PE/PE+) according to the import table (imphash) and group them by different colors (pay attention to the second column from output). Thus, colors matter!
2. Determining whether executable malware samples are packed or not packed according to the following rules:
      
      
            2a. Two or more sections with Entropy > 7.0 or < 1.0 ==> Packed.

            2b. One one section with Entropy > 7.0 or two sections with SizeOfRawData ==> Likely packed.

            2c. None section with Entropy > 7.0 or SizeOfRawData ==> not packed.
      
      
3. Determining whether the malware samples contain overlay.
4. Determining the .text section entropy. 


            Malwoverview.py only examines PE/PE+ files, skipping everything else.  

5. Checking each malware sample against Virus Total. 


# REQUERIMENTS

This tool was tested on a Kali Linux 2018 system and Windows 10. Therefore, it will be necessary to install:

## Kali Linux

1. Python version 2.7.x. 

       $ apt-get install python
            
2. Python-magic.  

      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:
      
       $ pip install python-magic
      
      Or compiling it from the github repository:
      
       $ git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic
       $ cd python-magic/
       $ python setup.py build
       $ python setup.py install
      
      As there are serious problems about existing two versions of python-magic package, my recommendation is to install it
      from github (second procedure above) and copy the magic.py file to the SAME directory of malwoverview tool. 
      
3. Pefile and colorama packages: 

       $ pip install pefile
       $ pip install colorama
       $ pip install simple-json
       $ pip install requests
       $ pip install validators

## Windows

1. Install the Python version 2.7.x. from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ 

2. Python-magic.  

      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:
      
       C:\> pip install python-magic
      
      Or compiling it from the github repository:
      
       C:\> git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic
       C:\> cd python-magic/
       C:\> python setup.py build
       C:\> python setup.py install
      
3. Pefile and colorama packages: 

       C:\> pip install pefile
       C:\> pip install colorama
       C:\> pip install simple-json
       C:\> pip install requests
       C:\> pip install validators
       
4. (IMPORTANT) Remove the magic.py file from malwoverview directory.

5. Install the python-magic DLLs by executing the following command:

       C:\> pip install python-magic-bin==0.4.14 

## Virus Total and Hybrid-Analysis.

You must edit the malwoverview.py and insert your APIs and secret to enable Virus Total and Hybrid-Analysis checking:

VT: 

      VTAPI = '<----ENTER YOUR API HERE and UNCOMMENT THE LINE---->'

Hybrid-Analysis: 

      HAAPI = '<----ENTER YOUR API HERE and UNCOMMENT THE LINE---->'    
       
# USAGE

To use the malwoverview, execute the command as shown below:

     Usage: malwoverview -d <directory> -f <fullpath> -i <0|1> -b <0|1> -v <0|1> -a <0|1> -p <0|1> -s <0|1> 
     -x <0|1> -w <|1> -u <url> -H <hash file> -V <filename> -D <0|1> -e<0|1|2|3|4> -A <filename> -g <job_id> 
     -r <domain>

  where: 
  
     Usage: malwoverview -d <directory> -f <fullpath> -i <0|1> -b <0|1> -v <0|1> -a <0|1> -p <0|1> -s <0|1> 
     -x <0|1> -w <|1> -u <url> -H <hash file> -V <filename> -D <0|1> -e<0|1|2|3|4> -A <filename> -g <job_id> 
     -r <domain>

Options:

      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -d DIRECT      specify directory containing malware samples.
      -f FPNAME      specify a full path to a file. Shows general information
                     about the file (any filetype)
      -b BACKG       (optional) adapts the output colors to black window.
      -i IMPSEXTS    (optional) show imports and exports (it is used with -f
                     option).
      -x OVER        (optional) extract overlay (it is used with -f option).
      -s SHOWVT      (optional) show antivirus reports from the main players.
                     This option is used with the -f option (any filetype).
      -v VIRUSTOTAL  (optional) query Virus Total database for positives and
                     totals.Thus, you need to edit the malwoverview.py and
                     insert your VT API.
      -a HYBRIDANALYSIS  (optional) query Hybrid Analysis database for general
                     report. Use the -e option to specify which environment
                     are looking for the associate report because the sample
                     can have been submitted to a different environment that
                     you are looking for. Thus, you need to edit the
                     malwoverview.py and insert your HA API and secret.
      -p PUBKEY      (optional) use this option if you have a public Virus
                     Total API. It forces a one minute wait every 4 malware
                     samples, but allows obtaining a complete evaluation of
                     the malware repository.
      -w WIN         (optional) used when the OS is Microsoft Windows.
      -u URLX        SUBMIT a URL for the Virus Total scanning.
      -r DOMAINX     GET a domain's report from Virus Total.
      -H FILEHASH    Hash to be checked on Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis.
                     For the Hybrid Analysis report you must use it together
                     -e option.
      -V FILENAMEVT  SUBMIT a FILE(up to 32MB) to Virus Total scanning and
                     read the report. Attention: use forward slash to specify
                     the target file even on Windows systems. Furthermore, the
                     minimum waiting time is set up in 90 seconds because the
                     Virus Total queue. If an error occurs, so wait few
                     minutes and try to access the report by using -f option.
      -A FILENAMEHA  SUBMIT a FILE(up to 32MB) to be scanned by Hybrid
                     Analysis engine. Use the -e option to specify the best
                     environment to run the suspicious file.
      -g REPORTHA    Check the report's status of submitted samples to Hybrid
                     Analysis engine by providing the job ID. Possible
                     returned status values are: IN_QUEUE, SUCCESS, ERROR,
                     IN_PROGRESS and PARTIAL_SUCCESS.
      -D DOWNLOAD    (optional) Download the sample from Hybrid Analysis.
                     Option -H must be specified.
      -e SYSENVIRON  (optional) This option specified the used environment to
                     be used to test the samlple on Hybrid Analysis: <0>
                     Windows 7 32-bits; <1> Windows 7 32-bits (with HWP
                     Support); <2> Windows 7 64-bits; <3> Android; <4> Linux
                     64-bits environment. This option is used together either
                     -H option or the -A option or -a option.


        If you use Virus Total option, so it is necessary to edit the malwoverview.py and insert your VT API. 
        
        Remember that public VT API only allows 4 searches per second (as shown at the image above). Therefore, 
        if you are willing to wait some minutes, so you can use the -p option, which forces a one minute wait 
        every 4 malware samples, but allows obtaining a complete evaluation of the repository.
        
  
        * ATTENTION: if the directory contains many malware samples while using -d option, so malwoverview.py could 
         take some time. :)
         
        ** ATTENTION 2: The public Hybrid Analysis API enforces a quota of submission per day!
